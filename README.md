# Online-Grooming-Detection

Online grooming approaches, where a sexual
predator approaches minors online with the
goal of sexual abuse, are a big problem in
today’s world of social media. In this work,
we present two approaches to detect sexual
predators in chats. We utilize the currently
available datasets for Sexual Predator Detection (SPD) and analyze their strengths and
weaknesses critically. Using dictionary-based
and transformer-based approaches, we analyze
the writing styles of predators in comparison
to non-predators in order to shed light to
their differences. Finally, we present our
two approaches, one of which improves the
current state-of-the-art score by 7.7%. Both
approaches are based on BERT models using
additional features of the chats as inputs.

This project was developed in the context of the course "Computational Semantics for NLP" at ETH Zurich.
My team Saahiti Prayaga, Philippe Schläpfer and I attempted to use NLP to tackle a pressing societal problem.
